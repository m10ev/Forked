# Forked

**Where experimenting is encouraged!** Forked is a community-driven platform for culinary wizards to share original recipes or "fork" existing ones to add their own creative spin. 



## Key Features

* **Recipe Forking:** Found a great recipe but want to change the spices? "Fork" it! This creates a new version linked to the original, allowing users to see how recipes evolve.
* **Smart Ingredient Parsing:** Input ingredients as natural language (e.g., *"2 cups of chopped onions"*). Our system handles the separation of quantities, units, and items automatically.
* **Ingredient-Based Search:** Search for recipes based on what's currently in your fridge, including specific quantity filters.
* **Social Cooking:** Follow other chefs, review recipes with photos, and save your favorites to your personal cookbook.
